# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This is my first kaggle project, I predicted whether customers with specific features would survive or not using Random Forest algorithm. 
I performed exploratory data analysis to analyze data set to find features strongly related to the response variable.
I did data cleaning and feature engineering to define new features potentially affect response
I trained, validated and tuned ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN and Random Forest, finally chose Random Forest with highest score 0.78
